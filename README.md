# SUNY-ACC-Recursive-Doubly-Linked-List
A doubly linked list implemented recursively. 
Be careful when increasing the "MORE_MEMORY" constant to test memory exception. This is because to delete list elements, you need space on the stack and if the stack is full you can't call delete. This is due to the nature of "recursivly implemented".
